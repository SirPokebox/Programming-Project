# Portfolio
For this programming Hackathon styled assignment, I had to develop a client-server application, an android app that connects to a
server which was provided, to retrieve data for it, and display the results. The application had to use GPS, to find out the names
and distance to the nearest railway stations. I was working with the android geolocation API, and had to parse JSON.

The files listed show pictures of the application developed:

For my application, I achieved a mark of 70. This can seen in the feedback.pdf file.
